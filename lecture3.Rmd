R has different data type
1. Numeric data type
integers
float or double 
logical character
complex
space start saying arguments
 every data type creates objects
 Vector its atomic one type 
 coversion between types 
 
 creating vector can only be one thing
 
 Variables: variables are usually two forms either data or function thinking about variable names you have to call em noun(what is this thing)
 
 ```{r vectors}
 # This is an example
 # Vector_1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
 

 ```
```{r vector2}
# This us a different, longer vector
vector_2 <-c(1:30)
vector_2
```

```{r strings}

(strings_1 <- c("abc", "def", "ghi"))
typeof(string_1)
length(string_1)

string_2 <- c("abc, def, ghi")
string_2
length(string_2)

long_string <-c(LETTERS)
long_string

```
```{r logicals}
# a vector of true/false

t_f <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
t-f
```

```{rfactors}
# start with a string
factor_1 <- c("a","b", "a", "b", "c")
# use cierctuib ti aje ut a factor

factor_2<- as.factor(factor_1)
factor_2
```
## Operations

### basic math opertors:
  $+, -, *, /$
  
  
  ###Matrix operators
  %+%
  %+%
  
```{r simple operations}
# add two vetors
vector_add <- vector_1 + Vector_1

vector_add

vector_multi <- vector_1 * vector_1
vector_multi

# this demostarateds reecycling which is using the same elements

```


```{r arrays}

array_1 <- rbind(vector_1, c(5:8))
array_1
```


```{r dimension}

length(array_1)
length(array_2)

dim(array_1)
dim(array_2)
```

##correction
all vectors can only b,e **one type**

```{r}

string_3 <- c(1,2,3,4,4.2,"a")
string_3
vector_4 <- c(1,2,3.3,4.4)
vector_4
```

## Indexing vectors 
vectors and arrays can be indexed to find specific elements

# the first vector in R is 1 and in python 0


```{r indexing}

length(vector_4)
#find the 3rd element of the vector
Vector_4[3]

# find multiple element using range 
vector_1[1:3]
subset_1

vector_2[1:10]

vector_1[c(3,2,4)]

vector_2[vector_1]

#multi-dimensional index

array_1[2,4]
array_1

array_2[4,2]
array_2

array_2[c(3,1), c(2,1)]
array_2

```


```


  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
```{r}

```




 
 Vector.1
 
 vectorOne (camel phase)
 
 all variavles good thing to use underscore and good thing to stick with one
 
 ```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
space says 

```{r types}


2+2

```

{r}

plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
